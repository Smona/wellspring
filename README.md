## Setup

In order to set up the project for development:

1. Make sure you have installed [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and 
[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/getting-started).
2. run `yarn` to install the dependencies.
3. `yarn start` will serve the project and open it in your browser. You're
good to go!
4. `yarn build` will zip up the contents of the public folder and place them
in a "build" directory.
